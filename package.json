  "description": "The motivation in this project is to was to write in the backend code for Get and Post request addtional I added in the Delete request. You will be able to create a note and also delete note. You will be able to create a note by typing in a title and text then clinking the save button in the top right corner.\r ## Problems\r To begin with this code did not have it back end code written so I was tasked with creating a api for the notes. The page would start then on clicking get started the page would error out. For me there were a few things different things I was having a bit of diffculty with. I had trouble with the readAndDelete function add using it correctly with Delete Path.Sepreating the code in order for it be a bit more dry as well.",
