## READ ME

## Motivation
The motivation in this project is to was to write in the backend code for Get and Post request addtional I added in the Delete request. You will be able to create a note and also delete note. You will be able to create a note by typing in a title and text then clinking the save button in the top right corner.
## Problems
To begin with this code did not have it back end code written so I was tasked with creating a api for the notes. The page would start then on clicking get started the page would error out. For me there were a few things different things I was having a bit of diffculty with. I had trouble with the readAndDelete function add using it correctly with Delete Path.Sepreating the code in order for it be a bit more dry as well. 

## What I Learned
In this project I grasp a better understanding how to use Express and the methods associated with it. Creating GET routes, POST routes, DEELTE routes as well. In my free time i intend to adjust it so the GET request can gather a certin note. Creating my own api is something I also intend to dive into. Being able to use Express routing was a focus of this project. Creating the backend I find very intresting and I'm glad i was able to create a personal api and server then use them to rend the front end of the code. I want to try building the back end first in different project that I'll be working on in my spare time.
